## Overview

CircuitX Swap is a privacy-focused DEX on Solana that enables confidential swaps, transfers, assets shielding using zero-knowledge proofs. Shield your assets, swap privately, and transfer/withdraw tokens without exposing amounts or addresses on-chain.

## Features

**Private Swaps on Solana Mainnet**  
Execute swaps on mainnet with full privacy protection.

**Shield**  
Shield assets into a private state before swapping or transferring.

**Transfer Privately**  
Send tokens privately so amounts and addresses stay off public view.

**ZK-Based Privacy**  
Zero-knowledge proofs ensure amounts and addresses aren't exposed on-chain.

**Multi-Token Support**  
Trade SOL, USDC, and other supported tokens.

## How It Works

### Privacy Flow

CircuitX uses ephemeral wallets and zero-knowledge proofs to keep your transactions private:

1. **Shield (Deposit)** - Lock your tokens into a private pool using a commitment hash
2. **Private Action** - Swap or transfer within the shielded pool
3. **Unshield (Withdraw)** - Withdraw to any address with full privacy
